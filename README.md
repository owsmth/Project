# Project
Calculator: We will be making a digital calculator that takes the user's inputs and gives the
appropriate result. It will include mostly basic operations, such as addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, and exponentiation. As a side product of exponentiation, square roots will
also be included, and we may or may not include them as their own separate feature. As for the user
input, the user will be allowed to enter the amount of numbers they desire along with however
many operators (so long as 2 operators are not used consecutively, excluding parentheses), as
opposed to being restricted on the amount. The calculator will solve using the correct order of
operations, accounting for exponentiation and parentheses.
